However at the time I wrote it, the latest SVN didn't compile under Silverlight. If you're interested,&nbsp;I documented these changes on my blog.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.synectics-tc.com/blog/Coordinate-reprojection-using-Silverlight.html\">http://www.synectics-tc.com/blog/Coordinate-reprojection-using-Silverlight.html</a>. I see on the CodePlex homepage that Silverlight is now supported, so my changes are probably not of relevance any more.</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow, hope you find the <a href=\"http://www.synectics-tc.com/resources/downloads/coordinate-reprojection.html\">online coordinate reprojection</a> system useful.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Cheers,</p>\r\n<p>Andrew</p>",

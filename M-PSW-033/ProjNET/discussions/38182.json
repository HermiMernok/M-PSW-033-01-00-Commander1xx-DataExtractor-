Basically what we need is a method that takes a longitude and latitude and converts it to the projection, and one that does the reverse.<br>\r\nLook at&nbsp;the DegreesToMeters and MetersToDegrees methods in&nbsp;\\SharpMap.CoordinateSystems\\CoordinateSystems\\Projections\\LambertConformalConic.cs to see what I'm talking about.<br>\r\nIf you can create these two methods, I can do the rest for you (if you want to keep it simple, define the parameters in the link you sent as constants).<br>\r\nNote that we would also need a set of points in long/lat and projected coordinates throughout the valid area for the projection (ie. not too close together)for the unit tests as well (which you are 100% sure are accurate).<br>\r\nFor instance see:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.posc.org/Epicentre.2_2/DataModel/ExamplesofUsage/eu_cs34e2.html\">http://www.posc.org/Epicentre.2_2/DataModel/ExamplesofUsage/eu_cs34e2.html</a>&nbsp;for a few examples\r\n",

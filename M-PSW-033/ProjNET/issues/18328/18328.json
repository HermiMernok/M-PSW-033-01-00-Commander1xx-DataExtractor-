    "Description": "According to http://projnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Supported%20projections, Proj.net currently only supports Lambert Conformal Conic 2SP projection. While for France, Lambert Conformal Conic 1SP projection is mostly being used. If there would be no request for this feature before, would it be possible to have this projection system supported?\n \nI don't have any experience in .NET programming, but I have experiences on other programming languages. Please let me know how would I be able to help to implement this feature.\n \nThanks in advance for all the help.\n \nAnto",

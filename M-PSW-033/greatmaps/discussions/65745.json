I would like to be able to specify a starting point, and then multiple specific geocoded points along the way all the way to a final ending point.

I would like to be able to map this route.&nbsp;I don't want to draw straight 'lines' connecting these points. i do want Google to create the appropriate route. But, as I said, I don't necessarily need to have access to the directions via your control (although that would be a plus).</p>\r\n<p>The goal is to be able to draw multiple routes at the same time each with a different color. Each of these routes will represent a 'delivery truck' that is making multiple stops.</p>\r\n<p>I hope this makes sense!</p>\r\n<p>Jack</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

The GetRouteBetweenPoints method supports 2 PointLatLong params for a starting and an ending point. It sounded like you may have implied that the control provides some other method for plotting a route along multiple points? If not, is the method I describes before (i.e. creating separate routes along each pair of points) the only option available to me via your control?</p>\r\n<p>Sorry for asking again!</p>\r\n<p>Jack</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

However I am having some trouble with it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Let me explain. I downloaded the Windows From version of the control then i added it to my control toolbar, dragged it over to the new form i made. &nbsp;On the Form's Load event I gave it a zoom of 13, a current position with a lat and long i knew, and then called the reload map method.</p>\r\n<p>While a map of the world shows up nothing I can seem to do to get it to zoom into the street level or anything like that. The best i can do is seen entire continents lol Any ideas what I am doing wrong? Thanks a ton!</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Phil</p>",

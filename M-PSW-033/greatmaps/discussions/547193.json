( FromLatLngToLocal only show the point with pair (X,Y) by integer)<br />\n<br />\nHere is my code:<br />\n<pre><code>        Dim ToadoX, ToadoY As Double\n        Dim point1, point2 As PointF\n        Dim p As PointLatLng\n\n        'Dim x As Double = p1.X\n        '\n\n        ToadoX =  MyMap.FromLatLngToLocal(Pstart).X\n        ToadoY = MyMap.FromLatLngToLocal(Pstart).Y\n        point1 = New PointF(ToadoX, ToadoY)\n\n        ToadoX = MyMap.FromLatLngToLocal(Pend).X\n        ToadoY =  MyMap.FromLatLngToLocal(Pend).Y\n        point2 = New PointF(ToadoX, ToadoY)\n        Dim the_brush As New LinearGradientBrush(point1, point2, Colorstart, AColor)\n        GPoly.Stroke = New Pen(the_brush, 5)\n</code></pre>\n\nThanks,<br />\n",

I am really interested in your opinion about &quot;is Silverlight support is good feature for GMap.NET or not&quot;, because probably I am missing something and GMap.NET was not developed for such kind of usage and you are not going to add this stuff to trunk. Please, let me know what do you thing about this.</p>",

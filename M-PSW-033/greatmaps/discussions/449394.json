The url format is <br />\n<pre><code>static readonly string UrlFormat = &quot;http://localhost/geowebcache/service/wms?LAYERS=01&amp;SERVICE=WMS&amp;VERSION=1.1.1&amp;REQUEST=GetMap&amp;FORMAT=image/jpeg&amp;SRS=EPSG:3857&amp;BBOX={0},{1},{2},{3}&amp;WIDTH={4}&amp;HEIGHT={5}&quot; </code></pre>\n\nMy problems is the BBOX returned by MakeTileImageUrl method is Lat/Long. I need it in Mercator projection. What is the simplest to convert BBOX from LatLong to Mercator? I'm using exactly the same code as MapBenderWMSProvider but it look like the method work for LatLong (EPSG 4326) only. Thank you in advance<br />\n",

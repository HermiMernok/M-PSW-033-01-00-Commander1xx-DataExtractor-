I added the references to the 2 DLLs &amp; used some sample code I found on various websites.  No matter what I try I cannot get it to work ... it always displays tiles that say &quot;<strong>Exception: The operation has timed out</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>We are sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level for this region</strong>&quot;.  I have tried different map providers, zoom levels, locations, etc &amp; I still get the same thing every time.  Can someone help me out?  I'd really like to use this control.  Thanks.<br />\n",

And could you please introduce me a site which I can get a working solution file in c# which I can debug the map providers? Because when I remove the GMAP.NET.CORE.dll and add required functions manually, a lot of errors raised and after removing them, no breakpoints in the mapprovider is triggered.<br />\n",

Relly helped me a lot and it is quite powerfull.<br />\n<br />\nI know some guys asked you before but any recomendations on how to use Map.BoundsOfMap<br />\nWhenever and however i try to use it, afterwards it doesnt seem possible to drag the map.<br />\nI am working with WPF. Here the code i tried so far: <br />\n<pre><code>LiveViewMap.BoundsOfMap = new RectLatLng(new PointLatLng(0, 0), new SizeLatLng(-180, -180));\n\nLiveViewMap.BoundsOfMap = new RectLatLng(new PointLatLng(180, 0), new SizeLatLng(180, 180));\n\nLiveViewMap.BoundsOfMap = new RectLatLng(new PointLatLng(180, 0), new SizeLatLng(0, 0));\n\nLiveViewMap.BoundsOfMap = new RectLatLng(new PointLatLng(180, 20), new SizeLatLng(180, 180));\n\nand so on\n\n</code></pre>\n\nEDIT// I Worked on the last hot build.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nAny sugestions on how to get it to work?<br />\n<ol>\n<li>\nEDIT// I checked your source code. <br />\nIn the Project Gmap.NET.WindowsPresentation,  in the class GmapControl the methode OnMouseMove contains an if statement to check if BoundsOfMap has a value and if the curren Position is outside that Boundary.<br />\nBut inside the if-Statement there is no Code. I have the strong feeling, there is missing quite some code so it doesnt work.<br />\n</li>\n</ol>\nHope i could help you with it.<br />\nDo you have any tipps on how to fix it in my project. A kind of workaround or something?<br />\n<br />\nGreetings<br />\nnicosurf<br />\n",

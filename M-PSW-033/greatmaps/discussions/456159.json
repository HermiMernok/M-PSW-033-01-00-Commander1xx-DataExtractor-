This is great.\r<br />\n<br />\nThere is one problem regarding distance calculation i think.\r<br />\nI noticed you use haversine formula, <a href=\"http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html</a> for it. But you use semi-major axis of ellipsoid as &quot;Axis&quot; parameter instead Earth average radius. This will give more precision on equatorial places, but more calculation error as distance from the equator. I think should be use R = 6371210 m. Or need use more complex calculations ( semi-major axis of ellipsoid,  semi-minor axis of ellipsoid and calculate Earth radius for middle point between start point and end point). \r<br />\n<br />\nBest regards.<br />\n",

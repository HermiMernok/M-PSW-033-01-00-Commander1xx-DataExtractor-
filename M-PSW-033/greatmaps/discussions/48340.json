This error says &quot;It couldn't to access to the method 'System.Threading.EventWaitHandle'&quot;. In addition, when I open the Demo.WindowsMobile project, initially there aren't the GMap.Net.Core and GMap.Net.WindowsMobile references. I don´t know what to do in order that it works correctly. I need some program to install before? Which are the requirements that I need in order that works the Demo.WindowsMobile project? I hope your answer soon, please. Thank you very much!!<br>\r\n",

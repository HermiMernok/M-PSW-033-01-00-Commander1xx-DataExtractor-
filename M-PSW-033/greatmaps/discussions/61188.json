So far I like it very, as I was in need for such a control to improve my geocache manager. :o)</p>\r\n<p>I got some trouble understanding why you have implemented GMap.NET.Point and GMap.NET.Size classes ?<br>So I removed them from your change set 34796 and inserted &quot;using System.Drawing&quot; and I couldn't notice any disfunctions so far.</p>\r\n<p>Further I'll be implementing a marker class to display the typical Google markers, but to have the rectangle area centered around the marker (i.e. return.Offset(- HalfWidthOfImage, - FullHeightOfImage) ) and giving a choice of different marker colors in one class.</p>\r\n<p>Would you like to merge my modifications ?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Greetings</p>\r\n<p>DeepCore</p>",

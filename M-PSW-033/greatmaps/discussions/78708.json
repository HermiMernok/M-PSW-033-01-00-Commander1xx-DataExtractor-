    "Html": "Great that works.  I was looking for &quot;Rotation&quot; properties and never happened to see &quot;Bearing.&quot;\r<br />\n<br />\nI am having some limited success, however.  All my routes work fine. My normal map markers work fine. I do have one map marker which is an arrow representing your direction of travel: so that marker's OnRender function had code in it to do a RotationTransform and TranslateTransform already. So I just made a small modification to adjust for the rotation of the map as well - works great.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy issue is with GMapImage. Here was my original OnRender function which worked perfectly fine before I began rotating the map around:<br />\n<pre><code>public override void OnRender(Graphics g)\n{\n    if (image == null)\n        return;\n\n    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(LocalPosition.X, LocalPosition.Y, Size.Width, Size.Height);\n    g.DrawImage(image, rect);\n    g.DrawRectangle(Outline, rect);    \n}</code></pre>\n\nSo, naturally, I just did the transforming that I was used to doing with the arrow marker I described above to have it also rotate with the map:<br />\n<pre><code>public double MapBearing { get; set; }\n\npublic override void OnRender(Graphics g)\n{\n    if (image == null)\n        return;\n\n    g.RotateTransform(Convert.ToSingle(MapBearing));\n    g.TranslateTransform(LocalPosition.X, LocalPosition.Y, System.Drawing.Drawing2D.MatrixOrder.Append);\n\n    Rectangle rect = new Rectangle(0, 0, Size.Width, Size.Height);\n    g.DrawImage(image, rect);\n    g.DrawRectangle(Outline, rect);    \n}</code></pre>\n\nBut this is not working at all. The image plots in different locations based on zoom and as I pan the map, it's moves wildly around the screen. Something is not tracking correctly to keep it aligned with the rotating map. Any suggestions?\r<br />\n<br />\nI was worried that doing a rotation on the marker and then doing a rotation on the image was the problem but they are both on separate overlays, so I assume that is not the issue.<br />\n",

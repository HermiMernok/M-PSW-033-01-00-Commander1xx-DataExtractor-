I use this DLL in my project because I store data in a SQL Compact 3.5 database. \r<br />\n<br />\nBy freezing I mean that the app stops working, gets locked.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there any known incompatibility with this DLL? \r<br />\n<br />\nThank you.\r<br />\n<br />\nP.S.: Changed to discussions as requested by radioman<br />\n",

Here is an example of a URL that throws an error:\r<br />\n<br />\n<a href=\"http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;output=dragdir&amp;doflg=p&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=ls&amp;q=&amp;saddr=@40.637666,-73.947676&amp;daddr=@40.655961,-73.950774\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&output=dragdir&doflg=p&hl=en&mra=ls&q=&saddr=@40.637666,-73.947676&daddr=@40.655961,-73.950774</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nIf your try to navigate to this URL, you'll receive a 404... unless you remove the output=dragdir parameter.<br />\n\r<br />\nDoes anyone know if google recently removed the ability to receive json in this manner?  Are there any plans for a work around here if so?<br />\n\r<br />\nThanks for any help anyone can give me.\r<br />\n<br />\nScott<br />\n",

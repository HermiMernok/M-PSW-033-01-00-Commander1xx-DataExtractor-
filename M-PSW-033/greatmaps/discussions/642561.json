This is a great component and I use it a lot!\r<br />\n<br />\nI've been trying to use GoogleSatelliteMap lately but it seems it's not really working.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen using Demo.WindowsForms.exe some areas are all 404s, some areas are in very low resolution, and some areas are in a 'meh' resolution. I've tried using &quot;ServerOnly&quot; mode but still I could quite get the proper map resolutions (Definately not what you get on the google maps website).\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this a google issue? Or a licensing issue?\r<br />\nI'm using the latest GMap.NET version (just downloaded).\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm based in Israel (but I've tried in other places with the same results)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks\r<br />\nNitay<br />\n",

Specifically the &quot;GetRoute&quot; functionality as in the following snippet:<br />\n<pre><code>        PointLatLng start = new PointLatLng(29.1878, 82.1306);      //Ocala, Fl\n        PointLatLng end = new PointLatLng(29.6520, 82.3250);        //Gainsville, FL\n        MapRoute route = GMapProviders.GoogleMap.GetRoute(start, end, false, false, 15);\n</code></pre>\n\nThe route returns null and I have tried dozens of &quot;providers&quot; with the same result.  Searching on the topic yields a paucity of results at least four years old leading me to think this is a dead control and I need to look elsewhere in order to obtain a route between two US cities.  Am I missing something?<br />\n",

Do you have any examples with best practices for creating routes? \r<br />\nFor example, I need two routes, lets say green and red, points are supplied by my code. \r<br />\n<br />\nI see that you can add GMapRoute instance to map.Markers collection, but nothing is displayed. Do I always need to provide Shape, even it's just a colored line?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you!<br />\n",

Very cool tool.<br />\n<br />\nI have a few questions about it:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Is this tool using the Google Maps API v2 or v3? </li>\n<li>\nIs there an API difference between the download on the main page (1.6 Power) and the latest changes from the stable branch?<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nV2 is going to be deprecated as of in about a week (May 19) or a few months (November 19, 2013) see [<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/v2/](The\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/v2/](The</a> API Homepage). What will no longer work when that happens? <br />\n<br />\nI plan to use an OpenStreetMaps source as my primary source, but there have been requests to include Google Maps. If GMap.NET is using API v2 I'd rather just drop Google Maps to avoid trouble :)<br />\n<br />\nDoes GMap.NET also use the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Geocoding API</a>? If so, which version? <br />\n<br />\nIt looks like SetCurrentPositionByKeywords() uses Google's Geocoding API as a GeocodingProvider.<br />\n<br />\nEdit:<br />\nHow are Bing / Yahoo / other commercial providers with this project? Are any of them opposed like Google is?<br />\n",

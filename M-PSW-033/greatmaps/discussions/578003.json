With ZoomAndCenter works fine for the &quot;center&quot; of the marker, but the 600m circles aren't shown(often they are outside of the mapbounds). Do you have a idea how to watch the the markerssize for calculation in this function?<br />\n<pre><code>public RectLatLng? GetRectOfAllMarkers(string overlayId)</code></pre>\n\nThanks for this great piece of work!\r<br />\nBye robbeEDE<br />\n",

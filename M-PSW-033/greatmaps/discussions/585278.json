The map is created only once, and there are a bunch of routes and overlays drawn only once in the form constructor. \r<br />\nThe only repetitive action happening related to the GMapControl is the hiding and displaying of the routes (they have already been drawn once at load). \r<br />\n<br />\nOnce the application runs continuously for about 8 minutes, 10000 window handlers are created and the application crashes. A win32.exe error is thrown saying &quot;Error creating window handles&quot;. Is there perhaps a Dispose() method that needs to be explicitly called for certain controls in GMap.NET? Is there another possibility?<br />\n",

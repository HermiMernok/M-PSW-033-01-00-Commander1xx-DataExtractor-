However when I replace shadow50.png with my own shadow png using a different shape, it is not displayed. The new png is the same size as shadow50.png, also with transparency.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a trick for creating the shadow? Special format?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nJim400<br />\n",

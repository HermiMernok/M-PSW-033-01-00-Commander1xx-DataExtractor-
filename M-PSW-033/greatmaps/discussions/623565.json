    "Html": "hm right, the casting could be the problem and a difference in 0.00005° would result in a offset of 5 meters when using the earths radius of 6378km and assumeing that the earth is a sphere. That looks like the difference I get when comparing the two maps.<br />\n<br />\nWPF is pixel independent yes but in full zoom stage the error resulting from pixel difference should not be a big problem or am I wrong?<br />\n<br />\nI tried Windows Form and that is much closer to Google Earth...<br />\nIs there any way fixing that in WPF?<br />\n<br />\nThanks for your response and keep up the good work!<br />\n",

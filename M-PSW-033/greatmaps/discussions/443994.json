I modified demo to use my API key instead of default. <br />\n<br />\nWith beta version, I have trouble with rendering tiles. Some tiles get stuck being blurry and too big for their size. See this image:<br />\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8AQyzMj.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n<br />\nI highlighted some of the mis-rendered tiles with a black outline. What could be causing this issue? <br />\n<br />\nCloudmade works just fine with same API key in the V1.6 power release. I'd greatly appreciate any assistance with this issue. <br />\n",

    "Html": "It is repeatable issue. \r<br />\n<br />\nPlug in a working CloudMade API key and them drag the map around to cause new tiles to load. Some tiles will randomly load like shown above. I registered a testing API key for CloudMade. Feel free to use it:<br />\n<pre><code>// From CloudMadeMapProvider.cs\nCloudMadeMapProvider()\n      {\n          Key = &quot;40a1fe83563e46ee8ea6e030eabe6380&quot;; // my demo key for CloudMade\n         StyleID = 1; // grab your style here http://maps.cloudmade.com/?styleId=45363\n      }</code></pre>\n\nFor the affected tiles, it seems like an image from the wrong zoom level is loaded instead, or the rendering process is stopped before it completes. Note how the roads in the affected tiles are much thicker than in neighboring tiles.<br />\n",

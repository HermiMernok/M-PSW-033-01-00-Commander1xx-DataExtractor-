The problem I am facing is that my app slows down as I keep adding more markers, and in my particular case, becomes un-usable after marking ~(5k) points.\r<br />\nSecondly, when I monitor the ram consumption, I notice that the RAM usage increases proportionally with the addition of points up until it reaches ~40mb of usage, after which it increases very slowly. The memory doesn't free up even when I clear all the markers and fences..<br />\n",

    "Html": "I <strong>think</strong> this is possible and that I am just messing it up. My map has two Overlays (storesOverlay and trucksOverlay). The storesOverlay shows an icon but the tooltip text is not visible unless OnMouseOver happens. I add the markers and they are added to the storesOverlay. The trucksOverlay have tooltip text visible always. Those are added as trucks are added to the system (or updated).\r<br />\n<br />\nThe problem I am encountering is that  the color of the tooltips are the same when a truck update is added. When the program launches, the store tooltips are correct. You can't see them until you mouseover. When you mouseover, they are the correct color (orange/floralwhite). But when a truck updates, if I mouseover a store, the colors are the same as the truck. So instead of orange/floralwhite I get the truck colors (blue/yellow) for the stores.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan anyone help me figure out where I might be doing something wrong?  Or are marker settings the same across all Overlays?\r<br />\n<br />\nHere is the code I'm currently using.\r<br />\n<br />\n'in form load I add both overlays and make them visible<br />\n<pre><code>myMap.Overlays.Add(storesOverlay)\nstoresOverlay.IsVisibile = True\n\nmyMap.Overlays.Add(trucksOverlay)\ntrucksOverlay.IsVisibile = True</code></pre>\n\n'this is how trucks are loaded when they first update - after that I simply change PointLatLng<br />\n<pre><code>Dim truckMarker As GMarkerGoogle = Nothing\nDim oPointLatLong = New PointLatLng(truck.Latitude, truck.Longitude)\nDim myImage As Image = Image.FromFile(myConfig.appFolder &amp; &quot;images\\&quot; &amp; truck.MobileImage, False)\n\ntruckMarker = New GMarkerGoogle(oPointLatLong, myImage)\n\ntruckMarker.ToolTipText = truck.truckName\ntruckMarker.ToolTipMode = MarkerTooltipMode.Always\ntruckMarker.ToolTip.Stroke.Color = Color.Blue\ntruckMarker.ToolTip.Fill = Brushes.LightYellow\ntrucksOverlay.Markers.Add(truckMarker)</code></pre>\n\n'this is a Sub called LoadStoreLocations (completely separate from where truck markers are added/updated) .\r<br />\n'this is called when the program is first loaded.<br />\n<pre><code>Dim storeMarker As GMarkerGoogle = Nothing\nDim oPointLatLong = New PointLatLng(store.Latitude, store.Longitude)\nDim myImage As Image = Image.FromFile(myConfig.appFolder &amp; &quot;storePic.png&quot;, False)\n\nstoreMarker = New GMarkerGoogle(oPointLatLong, myImage)\n\nstoreMarker.ToolTipText = store.storeNumber\nstoreMarker.ToolTipMode = MarkerTooltipMode.OnMouseOver\nstoreMarker.ToolTip.Stroke.Color = Color.Orange\nstoreMarker.ToolTip.Fill = Brushes.FloralWhite\nstoresOverlay.Markers.Add(storeMarker)</code></pre>\n\n",

E.g If one marker is on London then zoom level should be 14 but if one marker is on London and one is on Paris then zoom level should be 10. This is just for the sake of example. The real scenario is there can be one marker or 50 and on different Lat/Long. I need to show all markers and set zoom according to these markers. E.g If I have 10 markers on map and all these are visible on zoom level 8 then I need to set zoom level 8 and if all these markers are visible on 13 then I need to set the zoom 13.</p>\r\n<p>I need this in Windows Forms.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

E.G mp.ZoomAndCenterMarkers set the zoom level but scale of this zoom level remains same which I had set explicitly but I also want to change the scale according to zoom level.",

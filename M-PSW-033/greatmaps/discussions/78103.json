Now this is easy enough using the mapmarkers, but what we ideally require is to have the drawing shape at runtime as the mouse is being dragged. (Please have a look at this sample <a href=\"http://www.timfanelli.com/item/177\">http://www.timfanelli.com/item/177</a>, should explain it better)</p>\r\n<p>We are making use of the WPF platform in this instance.</p>\r\n<p>Has this been done?</p>\r\n<p>I have toyed with the idea of having a transparent canvas overlayed on the gmap canvas, which will catch and handle the relevant mouse events - but introducing transparency brings together a new set of issues altogether.</p>\r\n<p>Any ideas or guidelines in this will be greatly appreciated!</p>\r\n<p>Cheers!</p>",

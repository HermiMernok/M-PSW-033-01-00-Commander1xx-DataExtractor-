I don't what to use the prefetch feature because I don't know where the user will be looking at and I would think it is not practical to prefetch the whole world , correct ? \r<br />\n<br />\nRadioman suggested  a copy/paste for one of the providers and change the server URL to GeorServer URL. I downloaded the GeorServer and it came preloaded with some maps . Now I need to run a test to see if I can use it . what is my URL at this point ?<br />\n\r<br />\nlooking at <br />\n<pre><code>string MakeTileImageUrl(GPoint pos, int zoom, string language)\n      {\n         char letter = ServerLetters[GetServerNum(pos, 3)];\n         return string.Format(UrlFormat, letter, zoom, pos.X, pos.Y);\n      }</code></pre>\n\nand <br />\n<pre><code>static readonly string UrlFormat = &quot;http://{0}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{1}/{2}/{3}.png&quot;;</code></pre>\n\nI know that this URL is for Open Street Map. what would be my GeeoServer URL ? Does it have to point to a specific shape file , layer , tiles ? Is it possible to add this as a feature in future releases giving the fact that a lot of people requested this feature and it will make Gmap even dramatically more superior than DotSpatial or EasyGIS, ..etc \r<br />\n<br />\nThank you  <br />\n",

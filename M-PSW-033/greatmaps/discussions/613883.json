Now I need to export a list with some position based on this same route. Something like: for each 10m on the route I generate a new point...\r<br />\n<br />\nFor example, I generate one route with 3 points and need to export that with 10 points. \r<br />\n<br />\nAny idea?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any anwers and sorry about my english! =P<br />\n",

When clicking a row in the grid, a position corresponding to information in the datagrid row is shown in the map.\r<br />\n<br />\nHereÂ´s my problem:\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I zoom and center the marker, the correct position is shown, however, the center is slightly off and the marker is found just outside of the map shown in the Gmap control.\r<br />\n<br />\nI have another GMap control in my project, where the control covers the entire form. This works flawlessly, so the problem seems to be that the center of the map is actually not equal to the center of the control.\r<br />\n<br />\nSolutions, anyone?<br />\n",

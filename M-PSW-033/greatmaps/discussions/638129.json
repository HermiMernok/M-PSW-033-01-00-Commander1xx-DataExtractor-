But when you zoom into this image, it should not stay the same size (like a marker). The image should zoom in too. How do I do it? It's kinda like creating a polygon at specific lat/lng and you can zoom in/out of the polygon. It should become part of the map. Let me know if there is confusion.  I am new to Gmap and this is urgent. Thanks<br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"https://yuq.me/users/29/474/k2P9N0UmWJ.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\n",

So these are the bounding coordinates for the image.<br />\n<br />\nBounding_Coordinates:<br />\nWest_Bounding_Coordinate: -80.107136<br />\nEast_Bounding_Coordinate: -59.729722<br />\nNorth_Bounding_Coordinate: 48.502223<br />\nSouth_Bounding_Coordinate: 38.660689<br />\n<br />\nHow do I set it in the code?  I only see two variables (gtl and gbr). gtl is for the upper left corner of the image but what about gbr? How do I figure that out for my image?<br />\n<br />\nI just tried setting the gtl and gbr but the size of the image comes too large. I mean the size of the image is already x-tra large but if the image is overlaid more towards the ground then it would be perfect. Right now the image size is about the size of the country (US) but should be the size of a state. Please help radioman. <br />\n<br />\nTried setting the lat/long for gtl. But I don't know what to set for gbr. <br />\n<br />\nOK I have figured out the bounding coordinates(lat/long). The upper left corner of the image is (48.502223,-80.107136), upper right(48.502223,-59.729722), bottom right(38.660689,-59.729722), bottom left(38.660689,-80.107136). So basically I need to bound the image inside these points. <br />\n",

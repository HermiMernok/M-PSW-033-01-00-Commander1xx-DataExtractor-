    "Html": "I'm experiencing trouble while trying to grab the contents of the hidden WinForms-based map control. What I need is to a) set the control's size in pixels, b) display map from specific provider and c) place some polygon overlays on top of it, and zoom to geometry extents. It's all working fine until I try to get the Bitmap from control - the classic ToImage() function fails, producing invalid results:<br />\n<pre><code>Dim ctrl As New GMapControl\nctrl.Size = New Size(600, 600)\nctrl.MapProvider = GMap.NET.MapProviders.OpenStreetMapProvider.Instance\nctrl.Zoom = 18\n...add overlay...\n...zoom to overlay geometry...\nDim img As Image = ctrl.ToImage()</code></pre>\n\nYou've probably noticed that control was ment to run on non-UI thread, thus no displaying Forms, etc.\r<br />\n<br />\nFollowing code fixes ToImage() issue, but the results are still not valid:<br />\n<pre><code>Dim bmp As New Bitmap(ctrl.ClientRectangle.Width, ctrl.ClientRectangle.Height)\nctrl.DrawToBitmap(bmp, ctrl.ClientRectangle)</code></pre>\n\nWhat I'm getting is a blank map with correctly displayed polygonal overlay. But, the map itself is unintialized - the tiles are not yet loaded. How do I force loading tiles, or at least how do I get notified that the tiles are fully loaded? One more issue is that above instanced map control does not get its ViewArea() properly set, although the Position() property displays correct value.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nMaksim Sestic<br />\n",

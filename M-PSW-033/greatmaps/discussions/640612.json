I have to plot a track on a map using historical gps co-ordinates and without depending on an internet connection at replay time. We use Labview and one discussion pointed to this forum. I have no background in .NET but think that Labview can be integrated in some manner with .NET.\r<br />\n<br />\nAm I in the right area for offline mapping or should I be looking elsewhere. I have read through the Wikia documentation and searched for a starting point.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help would be appreciated. Thanks\r<br />\n<br />\nRobert<br />\n",

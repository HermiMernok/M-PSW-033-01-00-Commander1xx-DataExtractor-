The other Google maps/terrain works.\r<br />\nFyi: Google Satellite service isn't blocked by firewall as it is used by other applications (not related to GMAP.net).\r<br />\n<br />\nInitially i though the Google version was changed (as it happened in the past). However taking latest beta version, didnt solve it.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny clue on why this could happen?\r<br />\n<br />\nBr,\r<br />\nGuy<br />\n",

So I thought I came up with a cagey way to create a system of undos, where whenever a marker is changed or moved, I'd copy the overlay.  That way i could move backwards through the overlays to show each previous set of conditions.  However, everything I seem to do copies the current state of the overlay to all of the other copies.  I tried the &quot;CopyTo&quot; method and got the same result.  There must be a better way.  Anyone have any thoughts?<br />\n",

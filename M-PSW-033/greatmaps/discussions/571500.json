    "Html": "I'm trying to implement a custom marker, and a peculiarity with how FromLatLngToLocal() is behaving in the marker's OnRender() is throwing me off.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs a very simple example:<br />\n<pre><code>public class GMapGroundImg : GMapMarker\n{\n    public override void OnRender(Graphics g)\n    {\n        var coord = this.Overlay.Control.FromLatLngToLocal(this.Position);\n        Log(&quot;Local: &quot; + LocalPosition.X + &quot;, &quot; + LocalPosition.Y + &quot;; Coord: &quot; + coord.X + &quot;, &quot; + coord.Y);\n    }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\nIn the above snippet, &quot;coord&quot; does <em>not</em> match LocalPosition; if I render something at LocalPosition it behaves as it should (its location is fixed on the map), but if I render something at coord, it seems to behave erratically.  Here's a quick screen capture to illustrate the behavior; &quot;LP&quot; (and the flag) is rendered at LocalPosition, while the red jumble of characters is at coord: <a href=\"http://screencast.com/t/XjLWPDtY4y\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://screencast.com/t/XjLWPDtY4y</a>\r<br />\n<br />\nMy understanding FromLatLngToLocal() was that calling FromLatLngToLocal with the position...should return LocalPosition.  Any ideas why it isn't - or more importantly, how to rectify it?\r<br />\n<br />\n(Note: I'm not actually trying to use FromLatLngToLocal on the position itself, of course - the final code is much more complicated, but the fact that FromLatLngToLocal() is returning unexpected results in OnRender - regardless of what I pass it - is what's throwing me off.)\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks very much in advance :)<br />\n",

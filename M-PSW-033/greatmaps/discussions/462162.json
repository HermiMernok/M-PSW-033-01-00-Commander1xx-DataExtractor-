I am facing an issue with 1.6 version as SetCurrentPositionByKeywords(&quot;haryana, India&quot;) is resulting into an error &quot;Exception in code&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried the 1.7 version also and that is working, however the method is different there SetPositionByKeywords\r<br />\n<br />\nI am using VS 2008(.Net 3.5) and the project in which I am planning to integrate Gmaps.net is on .Net 3.5, so I have to use 1.6 stable version. Can you please just give some pointer about the exception reported. I saw other users also have reported this issue but solution wise I cannot find any 1.7 version for .Net 3.5. \r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nAmit<br />\n",

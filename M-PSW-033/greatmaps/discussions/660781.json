Yesterday things went wonky.\r<br />\n<br />\nOn my development machine, I can not use SetPositionByKeywords at all. It doesn't matter what location I use (&quot;Seattle, WA USA&quot;, &quot;Dallas, TX USA&quot;, &quot;855 West Alexis Street, Toledo, OH&quot;) or what zoom level (10, 14, 18 have all been tried). Regardless of what I put all the map will do is go to the zoom level I have set and zoom to whatever the center of the map itself is at when I push the button.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis is where it gets wonky. If I compile the program and install it on another machine the SetPositionByKeywords works exactly as expected. And if I install it on my development machine it works fine. However, when running through Visual Studio 2015, SetPositionByKeywords does not work. It just centers on the screen to the zoom level I set.\r<br />\n<br />\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this? <br />\n",

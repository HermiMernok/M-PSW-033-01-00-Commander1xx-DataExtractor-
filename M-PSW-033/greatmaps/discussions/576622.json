I am using BingMapProvider. The polygon border will disappear, and create a diagonal line when I highlight each point, til the zoom becomes a whole number. I will work on testing other providers as time becomes available. <em>- Seems like all the providers have the same behavior.</em><br />\n<br />\nThanks <br />\n",

    "Html": "Hi there. \r<br />\n<br />\nI work for Microsoft on the Bing Maps team and stumbled on this thread. I thought I would correct a few inaccuracies in here. Bing Maps actually does allow users to directly access the road and aerial (hybrid) tiles for use in custom mapping applications like this. One restriction is that you can't mix the data from other providers such as geocodes from Google with maps from Bing. Since this app only shows one base layer at a time having other map layer options isn't really mixing of data, the main concern is overlaying content from one provider on the maps of another. There is however a specific method that must be used to access the tiles to ensure that authentication occurs and that hardcoded URL's are not used (They will break, they did last time we tried to update the tile URL's). The process consists of the following:\r<br />\n<br />\nCall the Bing Maps REST Imagery Metadata Services when the app loads to get the tile URL.  <a href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff701716.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">Documentation</a> This metadata URL request will look something like this: <a href=\"http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/V1/Imagery/Metadata/Road?output=xml&amp;key=BingMapsKey\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://dev.virtualearth.net/REST/V1/Imagery/Metadata/Road?output=xml&key=BingMapsKey</a>\r<br />\nYou will need to do this for each Bing Maps tile layer (Road, Aerial, Hybrid). You can delay this until the user tries to turn that layer on. You can then replace the different parts of the string; {subdomain}, {culture}, {quadkey}. By doing this the app will always be authenticating the usage of Bing Maps and will also have the correct URL's. We do change them from time to time. This will help to ensure that this app doesn't break.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>radioman</strong>,\r<br />\n<br />\nI can understand you want to make things open and that technically you personally may not be using Yandex maps but you are providing others with the tools to access them inside of the application. However, you should respect the Terms of Use of data providers. I recommend you review the Terms of Use and code of Conduct for CodePlex.\r<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Andrey Chebotarev</strong>,\r<br />\n<br />\nIf Yandex does not allow direct accessing of it's tiles outside of it's map controls you can report this CodePlex project. To do this you will need make a DMCA takedown request to Microsoft (Microsoft owns CodePlex) here: <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.microsoft.com/info/Cloud.aspx</a> Once this is done you can also report this directly to the CodePlex team here: <a href=\"https://www.codeplex.com/site/contact\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.codeplex.com/site/contact</a><br />\n",

Or maybe the Visual C++ team should take its tools off the Visual C# / IDE department? Or maybe Google should take its search engine off the market so people like myself may not have found radioman's 'tools'. Everyone is guilty/innocent/whatever. Maybe LCD screen manufacturers are the ultimate wrong-doers, without them providing a 'tool' at the end of the chain Yandex might now be happy?..

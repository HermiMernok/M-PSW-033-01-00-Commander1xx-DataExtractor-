On my development PC it works without problems.\r<br />\n<br />\nI use GMap.NET 1.7.1. I tried to update to 1.7.5 but I get the same error. Now I cannot go back to 1.7.1 because I get this error when trying to install 1.7.1: &quot;The change on C:...\\packages\\GMap.NET.WindowsForms.1.7.1\\readme.txt cannot be undone because a file already exists at C:...\\packages\\GMap.NET.WindowsForms.1.7.1\\readme.txt. The file must be deleted from disk for the undo to succeed.&quot;. Nothing works today... :-(\r<br />\n<br />\nCould you please help me?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\n<br />\nStavros<br />\n",

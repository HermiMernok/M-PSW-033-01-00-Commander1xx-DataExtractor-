Works fine on x86.... on x64 it doesnt download any tiles of any kind of google map. It used to work on a 3 month old checkout from SVN, but now we kinda lost this functionality. All machines are in the same network with the same firewall settings managed by the domain and forefront. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nAny ideas?<br>\r\n<br>\r\nthanks,<br>\r\nWojtek<br>\r\nKI TEAM<br>\r\n",

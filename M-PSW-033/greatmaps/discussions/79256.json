Here I opened the solution GMap.NET.sln &amp; ran it, there were some dll's generated including the GMap.NET.WindowsMobile.dll, I have read earlier discussions in this site about adding MainMap control to toolbox by dragging the GMap.NET.WindowsMobile.dll onto it. I followed the same, but I'm unable to see the control in my toolbox. I also tried adding the tool by Tools-&gt;Choose Toolbox items-&gt;in tab .net framework components, I added the GMap.NET.WindowsMobile.dll &amp; checked it. After pressing ok. I'm stil unable to see the control on my toolbox ! &nbsp;Can you please guide me how to add the control? Is there any other dll's i'm missing?</p>",

This might help all who have the initial trouble of using your tool, It would be very helpful.</p>",

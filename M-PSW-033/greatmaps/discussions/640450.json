It uses Google Maps provider.<br />\nThis project worked well. But today all users starts getting exception at time of operations with addresses.<br />\nI ran project in debug mode. After some steps i obtained &quot;problem place&quot;. It's in GoogleMapProvider class. Method GetRoutePoints creates web request with such URL:<br />\n<pre><code>http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;output=dragdir&amp;doflg=p&amp;hl=en&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=d&amp;q=&amp;saddr=@40.637666,-73.947676&amp;daddr=@40.655961,-73.950774</code></pre>\n\nException throws after invoking this request.<br />\n&quot;System.Net.WebException: The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found.&quot;<br />\nThe same error i'm getting when i'm trying to get to this URL with WebBrowser.<br />\n<br />\nSo, it looks like Google changed URL format for Maps, that implemented with RouteUrlFormatPointLatLng variable.<br />\nIs here anybody got the same problem? Maybe someone has decision for this problem?<br />\n",

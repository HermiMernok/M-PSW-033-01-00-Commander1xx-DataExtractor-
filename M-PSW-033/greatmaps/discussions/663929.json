    "Html": "Hi, I am planning on using GMap.NET for a commercial project I am working on. Is there a way to ensure when a user searches for a location on the map the only results to come up will be within a certain U.S. state? Due to licensing restrictions, we are only allowed to use OpenStreetMap as the map provider for this project. Sometimes when using the SetPositionByKeywords method moves the map to a location in a totally different state. It would be helpful the the program brought up only results from the user's state. The user is searching based on the street name, city name and state name for the location they are searching for. Is this possible using GMap.NET? The project is created using Windows Forms. Thank you for your time.<br />\n",

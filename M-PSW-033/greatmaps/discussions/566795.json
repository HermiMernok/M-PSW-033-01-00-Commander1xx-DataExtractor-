I have a set of coordinates, which are supposed to be used to generate heatpoints and display on said gmap.<br />\n<br />\nAfter searching both here and on google, i found this old blog which now is down:<br />\n(Dylanvester)<br />\n<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20130415062041/http://dylanvester.com/post/Creating-Heat-Maps-with-NET-20-(C-Sharp).aspx\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://web.archive.org/web/20130415062041/http://dylanvester.com/post/Creating-Heat-Maps-with-NET-20-(C-Sharp).aspx</a><br />\n<br />\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3d1W0xb.png\" alt=\"Image\" /><br />\nIt seems like it was the easiest way to generate the heat itself.<br />\n<br />\nWhat is the best way to generate a heat map from a list of coordinates, where the map are zoom-able and drag-able. Are there any of you, who have experience or ideas to how it could be done?<br />\nI don't think an overlay would be the best approach, since it would be hard to draw on a bitmap at the exact location from latlng and then match it to the map through overlay.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nIdeas are more than welcome - Thank you.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\n<strong>EDIT: i went with gheat.net</strong><br />\n",

However it does this on any MapProvider I try to use.<br />\n<br />\nNot sure if my code is wrong(Followed the demo) or if im having some sort of firewall issue(I have turned off my machines firewall temporarily to no avail)<br />\n<br />\nMy Code:<br />\n<pre><code>GMap.NET.MapProviders.BingMapProvider.Instance.ClientKey = &quot;my_key_goes_here&quot;;\n            gmap.MapProvider = GMap.NET.MapProviders.BingMapProvider.Instance;\n\n            GMap.NET.GMaps.Instance.Mode = GMap.NET.AccessMode.ServerOnly;\n            \n            gmap.Position = new PointLatLng(41.088327, -96.4748517);</code></pre>\n\nPlease advise.<br />\n",

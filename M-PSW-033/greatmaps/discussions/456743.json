    "Html": "Howdy,<br />\n<br />\nAn awesome application I wrote using GMap.Net all of sudden stopped working.  Couldn't add markers; map would just not respond.  So I ended up downloading the latest source and although things are working much better, I am having trouble upgrading my code.  In particular, the GMap.Net.WindowsPresentation.GMapMarker.RegenerateRouteShape method is no longer available, and neither is the routeMarker.Route.AddRange method.  Any help in working around these issues would be very appreciated.<br />\n<br />\nAnother issue with upgrading is that I used to parse out time and distance from a MapRoute Name but I'm not getting that information back, just the Distance in kms.  Where can I still get this information?<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\nRobert<br />\n",

This is less noticeable when zoomed in at higher levels, but doing this while zoomed out ends up being off by quite a bit.\r<br />\n<br />\nI think I have to get the &quot;hot spot&quot; of the current cursor and adjust accordingly.\r<br />\n**I use the cross cursor(+) for picking the point but it seems center is not center with that either.\r<br />\n<br />\nIf I find the answer, I'll share here.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using WPF.<br />\n",

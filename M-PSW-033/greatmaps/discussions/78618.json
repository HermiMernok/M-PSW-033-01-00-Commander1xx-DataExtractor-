How can Gmap.NET continue to find street names and addresses&nbsp;perfectly using this cached file when the required data doesn't appear to be in it?</p>\r\n<p>Am I looking in the wrong place?&nbsp; Is the data embedded in the PNG blob field?&nbsp; How can I selectively remove un-needed tiles?</p>\r\n<p>Thanks in advance.</p>",

Sometimes it returns wrong address, even if address, that I was looking for, exists. For example, searching &quot;Na Okruhu 394/3 142 00 Praha&quot; will return &quot;Na Okruhu 392/7 142 00 Praha&quot;, and searched address is a little bit to the right of that result. Is it an issue of your component, or may be it is an issue of api mapy.cz? Thanks<br />\n",

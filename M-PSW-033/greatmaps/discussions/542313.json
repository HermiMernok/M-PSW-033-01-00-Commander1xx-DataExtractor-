So I used <a href=\"http://adodotnetsqlite.sourceforge.net/documentation/csharp_example.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://adodotnetsqlite.sourceforge.net/documentation/csharp_example.php</a> this library to connect to gmdb database but it doesn't work, throw exception ( &quot;Attempted to read or write protected memory. This is often an indication that other memory is corrupt&quot;). \r<br />\nOther way I tried was to use PutImageToCache but it not exchange the tiles but add new. There should be method like DeleteTile or when in database exist two tiles to the same place, library should choose tile with newer CacheTime.\r<br />\n<br />\nSorry for my english. Thanks for all answers.<br />\n",

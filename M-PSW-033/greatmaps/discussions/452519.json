As during operation no internet connection will be available, I need to cache the map data somehow.\r<br />\nNow I'm wondering what would be the best solution. Is the sqlite database powerful enough to handle the image data of a whole (small) country like e.g. Belgium? I have tried to prefetch the tiles with the demo program, but it would last an eternity with the given speed to get into zoom level 19. Also I think that would be quite a bunch of data...\r<br />\nHas anybody  a solution for that?\r<br />\nAs an alternative  I think about installing a renderer (like mapnik) and a database with vector information and set this combination as a custom server for the gmap.net control. Has anybody done that before and can give me some advice?\r<br />\nThanks in advance!<br />\n",

It's about few hours of prefetching. And database is on my htc mobile sd card, works quite well.<br />\n<br />\nIt covers even small roads, but if you need higher zoom levels, there would be a lot more data, 10GB - 100GB...

And even more for the support you're giving here!\r<br />\nAfter reading through your links I think GeoServer is perfect for me! I'll try to add it as a custom server to greatmaps.net as it has done before, should work out fine!\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\n",

I'm trying to download  &quot;.osm&quot; maps from OpenStreetMap and use it locally. do you think it is possible to add .OSM to GeoServer and have it working with GMap.net ?   How was the performnace ? \r<br />\n<br />\nthank you <br />\n",

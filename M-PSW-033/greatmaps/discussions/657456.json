But I was hoping there might be some way of setting it for the entire overlay at one point.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, is there any way to change the background color of the tooltip balloon?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance if anyone can offer any suggestions or instructions on how to accomplish something like this. Any help or information would be very much appreciated.<br />\n",

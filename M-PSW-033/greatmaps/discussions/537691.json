Maybe even throw some sample code onto the discussion forum once in a while so we could work out some of the changes?<br />\n<br />\nFor example you have obviously changed the way you define marker types, but without any documentation or sample code its pretty hard to work out what they are.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n<br />\nDavid<br />\n",

Have tried most conversions (FromPixelToLatLong etc...) with no luck.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nAlso, for locating an address I use &quot;<span style=\"font-size:13px;color:#a31515\">http://maps.google.com/maps/geo?q=....&quot; </span><span style=\"font-size:13px\">which returns the coords of the location if found.  This is fine for a single address. However, how can I have a list of matching addresses returned when my search is ambiguous. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks anyone for help.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nChristian</span>\r\n",

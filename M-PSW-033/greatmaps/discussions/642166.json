    "Html": "I created a winform application and transferred it to a surface pro tablet with windows 8. It works fine but I want some advice or suggestions if anyone can give. Is there anything that I should do to make the application more tablet friendly? The dragging works perfect on the tablet but I guess the pinch zoom is not. Pinch zoom works but it doesn't work like it should. It is not so smooth. It doesn't zoom where the fingers are. I don't know if there is a fix for this. Also, I added the capability for double-click zoom and it works with a mouse but if I double-tap my fingers, it doesn't work. Any suggestions appreciated. TY<br />\n",

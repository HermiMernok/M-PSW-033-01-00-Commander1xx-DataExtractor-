However when i moved the map to China, i.e. Shanghai, a significant different between GoogleMap and BingMap can be recognized.\r<br />\n<br />\nYou can test it with this location:\r<br />\n31.2398662550348, 121.499669551849\r<br />\n<br />\nI am not sure if this is a bug of GMAP or a conflict between Google and Bing projection.\r<br />\n<br />\nAny idea is appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nBill<br />\n",

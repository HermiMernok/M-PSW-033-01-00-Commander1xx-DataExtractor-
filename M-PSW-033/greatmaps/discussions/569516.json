This polygon has some color fill with an opacity that allows the tiles to be shown underneath it. Now let's say I have another polygon B that isn't the size of the current viewarea but some other size and out of the viewing area.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen I scroll the map polygon A will always be shown. However, as soon as I scroll to the location of polygon B and it comes within the viewing area, I would like to XOR the polygons as to achieve a complex shape.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a particular method you would recommend? I took a look at the Windows.System.Media.GeometryGroup class which can be assigned as data to a Path. But I was wondering if there is a more elegant solution.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much,<br />\n",

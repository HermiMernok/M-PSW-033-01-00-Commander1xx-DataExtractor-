I'm trying to figure out how to get the tooltip labels to not overlap when markers are close to each other.  Any built in code solutions that have been created that I haven't found?  I couldn't make heads or tails of the code in the above discussion.<br />\n\r<br />\nI see an X and Y exposed for the tooltip position but that would mean looping through all tooltips and manually trying to plot things?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks for any suggestions\r<br />\n<br />\nFairway<br />\n",

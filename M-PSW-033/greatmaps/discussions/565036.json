I downloaded the GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation files and added GMap.Core.dll and GMap.Net.Windows.Presentation.dll as references,Then i added Gmap.Net.Windows.Presentation.dll to the toolbox. My problem is when i drag the &quot;GMapControl&quot; tool and use it a dialog box will pop up saying<br />\n<br />\n &quot;A reference to &quot;GMap.Net.WindowsPresentation,Version=1.6.0.0, Culture=neutral,<br />\nPublicKeyToken=b8b9027b614afef&quot; has been added to the project. In rder to use<br />\ntypes from the new reference,press OK to restart the XAML designer. After the XAML Designer restarts, re-create the control on the artboard.&quot;<br />\n<br />\npressing ok does nothing. Please help<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: Fixed it. I just had to unblock the dll files because they were blocked automatically since they're from the internet.<br />\n",

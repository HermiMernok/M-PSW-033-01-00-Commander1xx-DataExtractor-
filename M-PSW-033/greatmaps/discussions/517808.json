The properties of the selectedArea seem to provide Lat/Lon info, but I could not find a way to translate this into a workable format to just print  the selection. \r<br />\nIs there any info on this, or can anybody help me out?\r<br />\nThanks very much for any help!<br />\n",

Resolution is not important. If the selectedArea would expose a method DrawToBitmap(), that would be great!\r<br />\nThanks for any suggestions!<br />\n",

Solution was to copy same SQLite.dll version into default DllCache\\some_sqlite_version_folder\\ (for me it is C:\\Users***\\AppData\\Local\\GMap.NET\\DllCache\\SQLite_v84_NET4_x86).\r<br />\nBut still it has to be resolved some other way. At least it is required for you to use SQLite.dll from cache folder that we specify in cachelocation or primary/secondary cache.\r<br />\nI hope you'll find the solution and resolve problem. I'll copy comment to issue I've added to issue tracker.<br />\n",

I tried CloudMadeMapProvider but it came back as &quot;Forbidden&quot;.\r<br />\nDoes the map from the map provider come as a bitmap or as objects?\r<br />\nIf it comes as objects it would be nice to have an XML file or similar that can be tweaked to change the color of the map before it is presented by gmap!\r<br />\nI.e first time the map is loaded it creates an XML file that contains the default colors. With this as a template we could create more XML files with color tweaks that can be switched to in runtime!<br />\n",

We added a new CustomScale matrix that can be switched On/Off in the same way as GrayScale and Inverse.\r<br />\nThe CustomScale is set via a new function SetCustomScale that takes a color matrix as input.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease see below for changes.\r<br />\nPlease let us know what you think.

    "Html": "Hello,<br />\n<br />\nI am trying to create a simple offline winform (using VB.net) for viewing maps. The user will input a Lat/Lon and it will show a map of the area. So far this is what I've done:<br />\n<br />\n1) Create form with GMap object and added all needed references.<br />\n2) Open winform demo to prefetch map data.<br />\n3) Exported the fetched data to a .gmdb file.<br />\n4) Tested the exported data my going into cache only mode in the demo and importing the .gmdb.<br />\n<br />\nHere is my simple code in the Load function of the form so far:<br />\n<br />\nmymap.CacheLocation = &quot;C:\\Users[USER]\\Desktop\\Data.gmdb&quot;<br />\nGMaps.Instance.Mode = AccessMode.CacheOnly<br />\nmymap.Position = New PointLatLng(-25, 30)<br />\nmyMap.MinZoom = 0<br />\nmyMap.MaxZoom = 4<br />\nmyMap.Zoom = 2<br />\n<br />\nI get 0 errors upon build but when the form opens none of tiles load at all. I do not even get the blue tiles with the errors as if I was offline using Server mode. I am not sure what I am doing wrong. Could it be the .gmdb file? It worked perfectly with the demo when I imported the file.<br />\n<br />\nI am a little lost here so I would really appreciate any help. Thank you very much in advance!<br />\n<br />\nEDIT: I am also using the latest HotBuild to fetch the maps.<br />\n<br />\nEDIT2: After digging around even more in the discussion threads, I've noticed that CacheLocation can be a directory and that all .gmdb files inside will contribute to the cached data that can be loaded. However even with that I still cannot get it to work by using this line: <br />\n<br />\nmymap.CacheLocation = &quot;C:\\Users[USER]\\Desktop&quot;<br />\n<br />\nI was however able to get it to work by placing my fetched .gmdb file in the default cache directory. I really need to be able to specify the folder where the .gmdb file(s) would be located for the final product. Any ideas?<br />\n",

I've tried to use .cachelocation = application.startuppath &amp; &quot;\\&quot; and it makes a file there but for other users it also uses the appdata folders.  On some computers there are 25 users so the 256mb starts to be a significant portion of the hard drive.  I can't seem to figure out how to make EVERY user use the same tile data db.<br />\n",

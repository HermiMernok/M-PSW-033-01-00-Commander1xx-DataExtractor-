Can't the elements like GmapControl, GmapMarker, the events, etc. used in both projects? I mean, if I would like to write a dll that allows both applications to use it, how should it be done? I always need to define if I use the Forms or WPF dll. Thanks for any help.\r<br />\n<br />\ngreetings,\r<br />\ngustavson<br />\n",

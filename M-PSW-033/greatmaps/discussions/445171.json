In visual studio 2012 is my target platform set to Any CPU.<br />\n<br />\nWhen I try to run the application I get the following exception:<br />\n<strong>System.Windows.Markup.XamlParseException</strong><br />\n<em>Starting the constructor on type GMap.NET.WindowsPresentation.GMapControl that matches the specified binding constraints, caused an exception.</em><br />\n<br />\nWhat can I do to fix this problem? Thank you in advance :-)<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Edit</strong><br />\nTested the application on a different computer with Windows 7 (32x). Worked perfectly. Have no clue why.<br />\n<br />\n<strong>Solved</strong><br />\nUpdated sqlite. Now it works great :-P<br />\n",

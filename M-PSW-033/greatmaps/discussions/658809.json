I have a requirement to load only Online Maps.\r<br />\nTo accomplish this, i changed the Access mode to &quot;ServerOnly&quot;. After this, i observed that the tiles are not getting cached/stored on to the local database (GMDB File).\r<br />\nMy question here is, how to restrict the control from creating the GMDB File.\r<br />\nSince, i do not write anything to cache, there is no point in creating an empty GMDB file and keeping as it is.\r<br />\n<br />\nPlease provide me a way to restrict this control to create this file. Is there any other flag/property for this ?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks and Regards,\r<br />\nKishor Reddy<br />\n",

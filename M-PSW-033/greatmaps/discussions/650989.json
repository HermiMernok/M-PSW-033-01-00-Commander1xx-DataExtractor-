Can I call something to get viewarea to update, or can I hook into something so I load my markers after it is set. I have the same problem if the control is resized.  I need to reload the markers to show the markers that are now visible but the viewarea is updated after the override for resize.  Can I somehow force the viewarea to be updated?  Or is there an event I can grab that happens after viewarea is updated, so I can load my markers then. <br />\n",

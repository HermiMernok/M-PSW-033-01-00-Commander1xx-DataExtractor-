The online maps are showing perfectly but the cache mode is not working and all I see is tiles saying &quot;Exception: No data in local tile cache&quot; and &quot;We are sorry, but we don't have imagery at this zoom level for this region&quot;.\r<br />\n<br />\nI generated the cache using the Windows Forms demo application and I tested it with success. My cache was done in a single region (Lima, Peru) from zoom 9 to zoom 15. I tested my smart device application with different zoom levels (always centering the map in Lima Peru, PointLatLng(-12.047816, -77.062203) and setting the AccessMode.CacheOnly mode) but it didn't work.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn my project I've added the followind DLLs:<br />\n<ul>\n<li>GMap.NET.WindowsMobile.dll</li>\n<li>OpenNETCF.dll</li>\n<li>OpenNETCF.Configuration.dll</li>\n<li>System.Data.SqlClient.dll</li>\n<li>System.Data.SQLite.dll</li>\n<li>\nSQLite.Interop.081.dll (Copy to output only, it cannot be added as reference)<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nIs there any trick to put it to work?\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you very much.<br />\n",

This is showing the map without zoom (I see the entire continent), and changing the zoom in runtime (with a trackBar) does not work also.<br />\n<br />\nAny ideas?<br />\n<br />\nThank you.<br />\n<br />\n__**** Nevermind, here the problem was that I was not setting the MinZoom and MaxZoom ****__<br />\n",

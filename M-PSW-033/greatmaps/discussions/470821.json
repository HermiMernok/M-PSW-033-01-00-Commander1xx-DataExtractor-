My question is: there is any way to do the reverse and get a set whith all points on the route. For example, to open a KML file and view the XML code, along with the waypoints you can see all the points that the route has been formed. \r<br />\nSorry, i have difficulty with the laguage. \r<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",

I need to embed the library in a commercial application.\r<br />\nReading the OpenStreetMap and Google Maps policies (<a href=\"https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/maps/terms\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://developers.google.com/maps/terms</a>), it seems it is not possible.\r<br />\n<br />\nCan someone help me figure out if I can use those services? If I can't, why the library still provides them?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks<br />\n",

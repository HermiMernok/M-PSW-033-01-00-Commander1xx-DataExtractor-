I am using the CustomRedMarkers that are in the WPF demo. My guess is that the marker location is being moved by the amount of the marker offset, but I can not find a way to disable this behaviour.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhat I would like to have happen is that when the marker is clicked, a detail pane is shown for the object which that specific marker represents.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",

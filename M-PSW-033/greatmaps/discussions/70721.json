For instance if I have a full screen map and have the North Pacific Ocean in the center of the map I would like to see Japan on the left edge of the screen and the US on right edge of the screen.</p>\r\n<p>I think I have said this before, but this is a great tool. I am a new programmer so I am finding it a little hard on the learning curve, but your demo applications help out a lot. Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Robert</p>",

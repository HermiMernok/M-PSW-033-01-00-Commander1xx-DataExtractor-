In order to avoid crossing sides/lines I created and used an algorithm which sorts the points clock-wise. Anyway, I do have some problems:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>I fail to determine if a point is inside the area of the polygon (see image here <img src=\"http://oraromaniei.com/upload/Moncalieri_Torino_2.jpg\" alt=\"Image\" />). An example or a solution (in VB.NET) will be gratefully appreciated.</li>\n<li>My sorting algorithm works 90% of times. Is there any other solution for sorting the points of the polygon in order to obtain a solid define area? The polygons on the maps will have between 3 and 30 points.</li>\n<li>I also tried to use circles (as markers) but I failed because I didn't understood how to add the reference to the form constructor.\r<br />\nMy level of VB.NET is medium at best so any clear example or advice will be much much appreciated. \r<br />\nThanks.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Is this possible with GMaps? If so, how would I go about it?</p>\r\n<p>Cheers</p>",

I haven't looked at the WPF version just yet, but the app I am writing is a plugin for an existing&nbsp;WinForms application, so no can do... although I am sure I have heard something somewhere about interopability between WinForms and WPF... that a WPF user control can be used in WinForms... but I need to double check on that when I have time.</p>\r\n<p>Thanks</p>",

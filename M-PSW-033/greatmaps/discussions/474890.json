Sometimes they will lose internet connection, and there won't be a cached tile available at their location for the current zoom level.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs there a way to determine if a cached tile is available at a coordinate at a particular zoom level?  What I'd like to do is automatically zoom out one level if there is no cached tile, rather than show the blurry zoomed in tile.<br />\n",

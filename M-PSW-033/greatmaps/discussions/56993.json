If I right click and drag the map a little, suddenly those 2 or 3 markers will disappear and the entire set of markers I've created appear on the map.</p>\r\n<p>I also have another button that then .Remove and .Adds a sets of overlays. Once you've moved a map once for an overlay, that overlay will show the correct results and continue, no matter how many times you add or remove it. However the other overlays will show wrongly until you click and drag the map for each of them.</p>\r\n<p>Does anyone know why this is happening?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

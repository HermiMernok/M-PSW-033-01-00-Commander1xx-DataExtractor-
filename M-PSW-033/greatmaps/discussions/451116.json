Eg. 3-8 seconds to draw about 4000 to 8000 points. I have tried other variations and been able to speed up a bit vs the demo GMapMarker (Cross, Circle, CustomMarkerRed, CustomMarkerDemo etc.). At best i am able to process about 4000 points in 3 seconds. I test this by adding the markers, then removing them.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can see there may be other ways to do it, bypassing GMap marker and perhaps overlay a bitmap, but this is a lot more complex.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo wondering if i have missed anything in GMaps that would meet these needs.<br />\n",

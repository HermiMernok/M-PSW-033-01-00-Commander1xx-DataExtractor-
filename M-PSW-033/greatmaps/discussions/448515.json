Or am I missing something maybe and it is already implemented? I could only find the IsHitTestVisible property, which makes the route clickable, but then I would probably need to write some sort of handler for that and a simple tooltip without clicking would be so much better...\r<br />\n<br />\nIm using GMap.Net in Visual Studio 2012 in VB.Net<br />\n",

What I can do is, for example get the event of a marker click with:<br />\n<pre><code>Private Sub RouteTipHandler() Handles GMapControl1.OnMarkerClick\n        MsgBox(&quot;Test&quot;) \nEnd Sub</code></pre>\n\nbut the OnRouteClick oder OnRouteEnter dont seem to get fired?!\r<br />\n<br />\nI add the route and marker like this:<br />\n<pre><code>Dim r As New GMapRoute(route.Points, route.Name)\nDim m1 As GMapMarker = New GMapMarker_Custom(route_start, My.Resources.Marker_Start)\nGMapControl1.Overlays(2).Routes.Add(r)\nGMapControl1.Overlays(2).Markers.Add(m1)\n</code></pre>\n\nAny ideas?<br />\n",

It works very fine, but I must challenge some difficults now. Maybe you can give me some recommandations to find the right way.<br>\r\n<br>\r\n1 What's the best way to show my realtime-coordinates on the map?<br>\r\n&nbsp;A. with latest position on the visible part of the map ( MainMap.GoToCurrentPosition(); = not so good)<br>\r\n&nbsp;B. To show all the waypoints ass line ( on line and the currentpos is a vehicule.png )<br>\r\n<br>\r\nThanks for for your help<br>\r\nGreetings from Luxembourg<br>\r\n",

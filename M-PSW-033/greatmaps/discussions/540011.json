I'm aware that this is not the intended use for <code>SelectedArea</code>\r<br />\n but I used the rectangle’s location to see if route selection is possible.\r<br />\n<br />\nI started with [<a href=\"https://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/454475]\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/454475]</a> By building a route that consists of all four points ( four routes )  of  <code>SelectedArea</code> and used the functions in the link to see if the <code>SelectedArea</code>box intersects with a route ( start and end point)  but that did not work !  Sometimes I get a hit and sometimes I don’t.    Can you guys point me in the right direction?   I also need to select a route if it doesn’t intersect with the selection box (the whole route is inside the selection box). \r<br />\n<br />\nThank you<br />\n",

      "Message": "I believe the problem is that Google has updated their database. The latest source code has the Version for GoogleSatelliteMap set at \"192\". Where I am downloading, this works in very few areas. If I increase the version to \"193\". it works, I have tested that the latest us accepts is \"198\". So in short, the latest code will only work in certain areas where \"192\" is still a valid version.\nTo update the version requires the Core dll to be updated.\nI have posted an Issue on this problem (see next issue after this one)",

    "Description": "When the visible map is displayed and the provider is changed before all of the tiles have been recieved (not out of cache) some of the map tiles remain and corrupt the cache in the newer provider dispaly. This is a particular issue if you have a slow provider and switch between providers as the subsequent map diaplay can end up with several corrupt tiles, which are all re-scaled tiles from a lower map zoom level (lower number).",

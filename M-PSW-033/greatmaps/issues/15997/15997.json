There's more detailed bug description on: http://greatmaps.codeplex.com/Thread/View.aspx?ThreadId=236870\r\n\r\nNow, I'm not quite sure whether it's up to SQLite provider. I tried \"Managed Only\" version of SQLite + latest 64-bit sqlite3.dll and it didn't help much. Maybe the errors were caused by some other component?",

      "Message": "May be also linked to ticket #15993, although I didn't get any exceptions. I performed tests on several VM OS instances, starting from Win XP 32-bit up to Win 7 64-bit. It performs quite well on 32-bit OSes, but it fails on getting map tiles on 64-bit OSes (performs \"clugged\", doesn't download tiles and/or populates cache correctly/timely).",

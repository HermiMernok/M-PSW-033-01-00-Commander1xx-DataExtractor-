    "Description": "Hello;\r\n\r\ni was trying to enable GrayScale and Negative Modes with a RadioButton, so that in each CheckedChanged Event i can switch between these modes, the issue is that, if we make calls like :\r\n\r\n```\r\nPrivate Sub KRB_EffectGrayScale_CheckedChanged(sender As Object, e As EventArgs) Handles KRB_EffectGrayScale.CheckedChanged\r\n       \r\n            mapControl.GrayScaleMode = True\r\n            mapControl.NegativeMode = False\r\n\r\n End Sub\r\n```\r\nthe GrayScaleMode is some kind of ovverided in the second call to NegativeMode even if set to False, i guess this come from the code that implements these capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe Solution was to first Disable second mode and then Enable the wanted one like this :\r\n```\r\nmapControl.NegativeMode = False\r\nmapControl.GrayScaleMode = True\r\n```\r\n",

    "Description": "I'm over a marker/polygon/route with my mouse and the state of the item is \"IsMouseOver\".\r\nThan i use the MouseWheel and zoom in/out, so that i leave the marker/polygon/route. But the marker/polygon/route is still in \"IsMouseOver\". You have the same problem in the demo using +/-key oder curor-key moving the map.\r\n\r\nI analysed a lot but i couldn't find the right place to fix it, because it difficult to find the points, where the map ist moving but not the mouse :-(\r\n\r\nMy very silly bugfix for the concret problem is:\r\n\r\n      protected override void OnMouseWheel(MouseEventArgs e)\r\n      {\r\n            /* ... */\r\n            OnMouseMove(e);\r\n            Refresh();\r\n      }\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't satisfy me...",

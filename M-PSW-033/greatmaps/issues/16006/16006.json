    "Description": "I am trying to include the map application in a project I am working on. I tried to use a GMapMarkerGoogleRed marker but it throws a TypeInitializationException when I use the same code shown in the Demo.WindowsForms\r\n\r\ncurrentMarker = new GMapMarkerGoogleRed(MainMap.Position);\r\n\r\nIn the project I am using, if I simply add the DLL references i get a SimpletonCreator threw an exception and the tiles remain blue. If I include the Source Code then I get the exception.\r\n\r\nFor further testing, I removed the references in the Demo.WindowsForms and added the source code folders and once again I got the TypeInitializationException with the following error: \r\n\"{\"Could not find any resources appropriate for the specified culture or the neutral culture.  Make sure \\\"System.Windows.Forms.Properties.Resources.resources\\\" was correctly embedded or linked into assembly \\\"Demo.WindowsForms\\\" at compile time, or that all the satellite assemblies required are loadable and fully signed.\"}\"\r\n",

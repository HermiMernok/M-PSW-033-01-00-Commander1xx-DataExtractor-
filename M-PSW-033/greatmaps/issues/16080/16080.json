      "Message": "We are upgrading from 1.6 (Jan 2012 build).  Seems in doing so we have lost our controls, and gained the above errors.  Whenever I attempt to drag a new map control to the form in that project I get the SQLite error shown above.  I have the latest 1.7 build from 2013 (Hot Files list), though including the newer dlls seems to create this issue.  When restoring the original dll files the controls come back.  Any Idea on what the problem may be?",

I did see this though:\n\n__Instances Causing the Issue are:__\n\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/5i7ayg9.png)\n\nI went through modifying Initialize Component hoping that it was just a control definition that was wrong, but apparently it's something a bit deeper than that.  I can verify the new dlls work in a brand new project, but upgrading the existing project is failing.  Not really sure on what to do from this point, but any help would be appreciated.",

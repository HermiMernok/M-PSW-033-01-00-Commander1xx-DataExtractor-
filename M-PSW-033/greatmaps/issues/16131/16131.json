    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have one sample project that I used to test the GMap control sucessfully in a Win CE device, then I added the component (GMapControl) to a project that I already had and it started freezing the equipament when I instantiate the GMapControl, after some investigation I added the DLL 'System.Data.SqlServerCe' in the test project that was working fine and it started freezing the equipment as well. I use this DLL in my project because I store data in a SQL Compact 3.5 database.\r\n\r\nIs there any known incompatibility with this DLL? \r\n\r\nThank you.",

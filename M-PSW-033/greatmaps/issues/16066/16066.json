    "Description": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with the import / export. I navigated on the map and I went to some places which I want to save them...\r\nI used the export functionality. I closed the application...I turned off the Internet connection...I run the application - in cache mode option, I imported what I saved before closing the application…\r\nI tried to go to the places I visited before export with the same zoom value....I remarked that I have no enough clean view of what it was loaded.....\r\nIs there any problem with the import / export…what I can do to solve this issue, to download the map and reload it with no internet connection?\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nIbrahim\r\n",

    "Description": "I tested it with cities in the Netherlands, works perfect. Canvas size is dependent of the zoomlevel, but I had problems with zoom 0 (Black canvas) and zoom 5 (\"System.OutOfMemoryException\"), so I didn't use them.\n\nI also created a check if there is enough memory for a particularly zoom level, because the program uses huge amounts of it, and made a check if there is StreetView available on the adress in the first place.\n\nCreated some public properties, and made a UserControl dll. Also added copyrighttext, cachefolder, and loading bar.",

I was attempting to use it but in order to get it to work correctly, had to change the following line from:\nPoint rightBottom = FromPixelToTileXY(FromLatLngToPixel(rect.Right, rect.Bottom, zoom));\nto\nPoint rightBottom = FromPixelToTileXY(FromLatLngToPixel(rect.Bottom, rect.Right, zoom));\n\nThe lat/lon being passed to FromLatLngToPixel were swapped.",

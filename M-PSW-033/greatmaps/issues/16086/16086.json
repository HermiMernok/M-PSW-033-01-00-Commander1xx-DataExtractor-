    "Description": "Hi,\r\nI want to  draw my custom lines with label on the Map.\r\nAt first, I use system.graphics from Map, but I can't obtain what I want.\r\nSo I use Microsoft Visual Basic PowerPack: I create a PowerPack  shape container in which I put my lines and add it to the same panel of the Map and all work fine, I see my lines with label.\r\n\r\n__My problem__: __when I drag the map, my lines disappear.__\r\nI put the redraw of the lines in paint event of the map and I can see my lines, but only when I finish to drag the Map.\r\nHow can I see my lines during map dragging?\r\nWhich event must I trap?\r\nI can also use another method instead Microsoft Visual Basic PowerPack...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n",

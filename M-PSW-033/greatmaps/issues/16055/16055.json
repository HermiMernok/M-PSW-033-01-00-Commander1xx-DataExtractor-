    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nlibraries in general, or such as GMap.NET, should make it easy and intuitive for developers to start with. Besides a very nice library you created, there is one small problem found in one of the latest versions (5b4800f39423). In an WPF application you have to specify MaxZoom explicitly in the XAML file. If you omit it, you get a map which is not zoomable at all. This because the default \"maxZoom\" is somehow 2. \r\n\r\nSuggestion: remove \"maxZoom=2\" in Core.cs, and use the max-zoom from the provider. If the provider returns an empty maxZoom (whatever that means), set a higher (> 2) value as default max-zoom (maybe 18?). Of course, provider can also be changed to not return a nullable max-zoom....\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDaniel\r\n",

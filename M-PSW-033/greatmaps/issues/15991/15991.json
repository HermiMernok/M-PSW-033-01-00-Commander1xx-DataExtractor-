Thanks for all your hard work.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if you are interested in adding an additional map type? I'm not 100% sure it is the correct type or format, but if I could get a map type that shows watersheds like this purports to do, it would be really great. The link is:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=e82f41cba54f478dac7736a5e0d38f95\r\n\r\nI downloaded the code and could probably try it myself, but thought you might be willing to take a quick look at the resource to see if you think it is compatible.\r\n\r\nThanks much,\r\n\r\nChris Wilson",

Its a moving target for sure.\n\nYou think it would be feasible to allow user to specify \"custom\" map type and then supply url, or is adding new map type too complex to be configurable at runtime?\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nChris ",

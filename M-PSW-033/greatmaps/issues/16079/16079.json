    "Description": "As stated in https://greatmaps.codeplex.com/discussions/457156 I was using version 1.6, and upgraded to the lastest beta (a3237323fb63) which resolved an issue with SetCurrentPositionByKeywords.\r\nWith the upgrade appeared a problem with the color of the routes.\r\nI have the following code runing inside a \"for/each\" which displays each route in a diferent color\r\n\r\n                        Dim p As GMap.NET.WindowsForms.GMapRoute\r\n                        p = New GMap.NET.WindowsForms.GMapRoute(directions.Route, \"Camino\")\r\n                        p.Stroke.Color = colores(j Mod 10)\r\n                        RutaNueva.Routes.Add(p)\r\n                        p.Stroke.DashCap = Drawing.Drawing2D.DashCap.Triangle\r\n                        p.Stroke.EndCap = Drawing.Drawing2D.LineCap.ArrowAnchor\r\n\r\nthis section was doing fine in 1.6, but with this version, it draws all the routes the same color (the last color in the loop).\r\nIÂ´m doing something wrong, or is it some change in the new build that is affecting it?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\n",

      "Message": "I have the same issue v1.6 allowed for multiple routes each route could be set to a different color.  The latest hot build now allows for more flexibility with markers which is great but I lost the ability to change the color of individual routes.  The last selected color always colors all routes that color.\n\nOther then this routing problem I think this project is great!\n\nThanks,",

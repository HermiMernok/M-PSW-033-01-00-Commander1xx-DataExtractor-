    "Description": "I'm using a GMapControl in an AvalonDock tab. Marker shows correctly at program start, but when I change between tabs, markers disappears (their shape become null). I've read about a similar (or equal) issue [here](https://greatmaps.codeplex.com/workitem/16015) that told the same, but it was closed as solved.\r\nMarkers also disappear when the tab is dragged as a floating window.\r\nIt's still happening. I've searched for a possible workaround without success.\r\n\r\nI've attached a little sample project that reproduces the issue.",

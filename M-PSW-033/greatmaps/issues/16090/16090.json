    "Description": "Regards.\r\nI'm working on an application that uses GMap.NET to create routes from a few waypoints. My question is: there is any way to do the reverse and get a set whith all points on the route. For example, to open a KML file and view the XML code, along with the waypoints you can see all the points that the route has been formed.\r\nSorry, i have difficulty with the laguage.\r\nThanks.",

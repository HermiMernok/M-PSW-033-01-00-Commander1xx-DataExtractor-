      "Message": "Well since the user was'nt dragging the map; Yes.\n\nIn my case I have an application for a touchscreen PC. When the user presses his finger on a location and releases (for minimum 3 secs) a contextmenu is shown (Letting the user send the co-ordinates or copy to clipboard). But the contextmenu is activated every time the user pans the map. I then added a check for IsDragging, but since it's always true when the finger is pressed nothing will happen.\n\nIsDragging should tell the truth, or change name. In my opinion :).",

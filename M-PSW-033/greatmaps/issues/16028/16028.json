    "Description": "I have a custom provider that works fine in Winforms. However, on the mobile, only the one map layer is visible. The top layer is a small map and I use Bing as a background to fill in the surrounding area. \r\n\r\nWe use the identical code for Winforms and Compact framework.\r\n\r\nIs this feature not supported, or is it supported differently on the Mobile?\r\n\r\nThanks you for your fabulous effort :)\r\n",

    "Description": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nIn working with the latest code from the SVN and have run into an issue with GMapProviders ? GetRoute method. It is taking a very long time to query the points and return the results. The older version using GMaps.Instance.GetRouteBetweenPoints ran 100 time faster. Can someone help me on this matter. I am using GMapProviders.OpenStreetMap.GetRoute(?????). When I make this previous call for 300 vehicles the process took about 15 seconds. Now it is taking over a minute per vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",

    "Description": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm a beginner, so maybe this is an easy issue to sort but I'm lost and I need some help, please.\r\n\r\nI've downloaded GMap with these files (Demo.WindowsForms.exe, GMap.NET.Core.dll, GMap.NET.Core.xml, GMap.NET.WindowsForms.dll, GMap.NET.WindowsForms.xml, License.txt, VB.net).\r\n\r\nI'm working on Windows 7 and when I run Demo.WindowsForms.exe, I get the error attached and I can't get any map. I've tried to change the zoom, disable Firewall and something else, but I couldn't run it.\r\n\r\nI didn't find any information about this issue. If someone could help me, I'd be grateful.\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\n",

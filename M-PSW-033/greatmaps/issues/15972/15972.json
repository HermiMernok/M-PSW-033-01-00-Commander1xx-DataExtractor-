    "Description": "I installed the latest version of GreatMaps Windows mobile application on my Samsung Omina Pro B7610 Windows mobile. At start (zoom = 0) the image is displayed quickly. But as I increase the zoom level the application slows down and after certain zoom level = 5, the application does not display any image and crashes after some time giving some error related to \"device.exe\". Then i have to reset my device otherwise nothing works.\r\n\r\nWhen I run the same application on emulator, it works perfectly and there is no speed/performance issues.\r\n\r\nIts a great control but some how it is not working on the device. Can any body please help me out in this situation.\r\n\r\nNote: The performance issue is not with any specific map but is with all the maps.\r\n\r\nHope to hear from some one soon.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n",

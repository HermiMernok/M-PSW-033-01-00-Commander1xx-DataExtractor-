    "Description": "Hello radioman,\r\n\r\nsince I developed an application which lets the user draw polygons by adding one point after another I came across a bug with the most recent version. When the \"polygon\" only consists of one or two points I get an ArgumentException in GMapPolygon.cs, line 141. While for one point I don't want anything to be drawn besides the point itself I'd like a line to be drawn when there are two points. So I changed lines 140 up to 142 in GMapPolygon.cs to\r\n```\r\nif (pnts.Length > 2)\r\n{\r\n   graphicsPath.AddPolygon(pnts);\r\n}\r\nelse if (pnts.Length == 2)\r\n{\r\n   graphicsPath.AddLines(pnts);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nI consider this a proper solution and I want to ask you to include this change into your sources if you think I'm right.",

      "Message": "I tested adding the passed in endpoints to the returned list.  The route path is then correct.  I suppose one could argue that when you say BETWEEN you mean not inlclusive of endpoints.  It is also true that passing back the start/end points as the zeroth and nth items in the list is redundant data although this makes contstructing an actual route a tiny bit more painful.\r\n//mA and mB are 2 markers:\r\nList\r\n pts = MainMap.GetRouteBetweenPoints(mA.Position, mB.Position, false);\r\nif (pts != null && pts.Count > 1)\r\n{\r\n  pts.Insert(0, mA.Position);\r\n  pts.Add(mB.Position);\r\n}\r\nMainMap.AddRoute(new Route(pts, \"RouteWithEndpoints\"));\r\n",

    "Description": "There seems to be a problem when converting UTM coordinates in the N band. \n36N 565236 527266 converted to MGRS and then back to UTM results as 36N 565236 507266\n\nThe same issue occurs for other UTM zones in the N band.\n\nThe library is very useful, I hope you can fix this.",

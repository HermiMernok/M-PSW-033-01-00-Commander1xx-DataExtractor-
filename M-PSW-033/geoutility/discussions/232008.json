Because this procucts do not include any geofencing capabilities, geofencing is not part of the library yet and is also not in\r\n our todays developer pipeline.</p>\r\n<p>This does not mean that we do not include this functionality in future realeases. Geofencing is&nbsp;always a strategic option for our main products.</p>\r\n<p>This said, if you or anybody else wants to participate and incorpotate geofencing to this library, feel free to contact us and become a developer for this product.</p>\r\n",
